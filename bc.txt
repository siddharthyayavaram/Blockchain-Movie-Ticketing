make a user
user does a transaction

check if transaction is even possible ( no of tickets for that show,balance in the users wallet) - done

then verify transaction using zkp on password of wallet for that user  - done

have the changes apply to their wallet and add the transaction to their list of transactions - done

the method showUser() will just iterate through transaction list and print out all their transactions - done

createBlock() creates the block using the transaction that we have verified - done

then we use mineBlock() to add it to the main blockChain - we need to figure out how to have everyone have a copy of the chain

then it gets added after solving some problem - providing proof of work   -done

we can check both if the block is valid after mining before adding it and  -done

also checking if the chain is valid after adding each block for additional accuracy

make data in block as to string for the show      -done


changes____________________________________________

Blockchain class has chain list

main added which will make Blockchain object called blockchain

BlockchainUnitTest is not used
